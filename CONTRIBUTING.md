# 💡 Contributing to ETHOS OS: Ideas, Not Code

**Thank you for your interest in ETHOS OS. Your commitment to an ethical, secure digital future is essential.**

## 🛑 CODE SUBMISSIONS (PULL REQUESTS) ARE CLOSED.

Due to the critical, security-focused nature of ETHOS OS and its non-profit, anti-loophole mandate, we **do not accept public code submissions (Pull Requests).** The founder is handling all core coding to guarantee the integrity of the kernel and security stack.

## ✅ How to Contribute Ideas and Expertise

We welcome detailed, high-quality **architectural, algorithmic, and security ideas** via the repository's **Discussions** or **Issues** tab.

**Please use this template for all submissions:**

### 1. Problem Statement
* Clearly state the issue (e.g., "A specific type of VPN might bypass the eBPF hook," or "The current ECA dialogue lacks a recovery option").

### 2. Proposed Solution (The Algorithm/Architecture)
* Describe your solution using **detailed pseudo-code, logic flow diagrams, or technical specifications.**
* *Example:* "The eBPF program should attach to the `cgroup` hook and use `skb_pull` before transmitting..."

### 3. Ethical/Security Rationale
* Explain how your idea enhances the "no-loophole" guarantee or improves the therapeutic efficacy of the ECA.

## 🚫 Submissions That Will Be Rejected

* Submissions containing runnable code or simple bug fixes without a detailed explanation of the logic.
* Requests for features that compromise the project's core non-commercial or ethical mandates.

By submitting an idea, you agree that if adopted, the logic will become part of the GPLv3 licensed ETHOS OS codebase.
